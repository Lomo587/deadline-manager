#  Deadline Manager Component

A simple yet powerful web component for managing and tracking deadlines. It displays a list of tasks with countdowns and allows you to add new tasks with deadlines or durations. When a task expires, it will flash red and briefly shake to draw your attention. It supports sorting and local storage persistence.

- Countdown to deadlines, displaying remaining time.
- Expired deadlines show a negative countdown.
- Flashing red and shaking animation when a deadline expires.
- Checkbox to mark a task as complete, locking the countdown.
- List collapses and expands dynamically based on active/expired status.
- Tasks are sorted with the most urgent at the top.
- Local storage support to persist tasks across page reloads.
